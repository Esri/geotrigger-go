## func GetValueFromJSONArray
``` go
func GetValueFromJSONArray(jsonArray []interface{}, index int, value interface{}) error
```
GetValueFromJSONArray is a helper function for unpacking values out of
arbitrary JSON arrays. `value` should be a pointer to a value of the type you
expect to retrieve. Inner objects are of type `map[string]interface{}`. Inner
arrays are of type `[]interface{}`. You can pass down a pointer to an
`interface{}`, but then you are really better off not using these helpers, as
they use reflection to try and match types.

func GetValueFromJSONObject(jsonObject map[string]interface{}, key string, value interface{}) error
